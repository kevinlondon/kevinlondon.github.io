Hello! I'm a software developer in Orange County, CA. I work at
[Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/) and previously worked at
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com) on Prime Video and at several startups before that. I graduated with a [Masters in Comp
Sci](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) from Georgia Tech.

I write about building and scaling software systems, engineering practices, and lessons learned along the way. You can read about [my path to software engineering](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2019/12/09/my-path-to-engineering.html) or browse [my latest posts](/).
