Hello! I'm a software engineer in Orange County, CA, currently working at [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/). Before that, I spent four years at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com) working on Prime Video, and before that I was at several startups.

I have a bit of an unusual path to software engineering. I originally went to film school with Big Plans to become a cinematographer, and ended up falling into tech during an internship at a post-production company. Turns out I loved the problem-solving and building aspects of software more than I expected. You can read the full story in [my path to software engineering](/2019/12/09/my-path-to-engineering/).

I write about building and scaling software systems, engineering practices, career growth, and lessons I've learned along the way. Some of my most popular posts cover [code review best practices](/2015/05/05/code-review-best-practices/), [the Amazon promotion process](/2023/01/24/thinking-about-promotions/), and [DevOps from scratch](/2016/09/19/devops-from-scratch-pt-1/). 

These days I'm particularly interested in how AI is changing software development and what that means for our industry. I have a Masters in Computer Science from [Georgia Tech](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/).
