I have had a bit of a strange career history. 

I wanted to be a cinematographer. In community college, I studied photography and shifted into
film studies, where I still focused on visual storytelling. I decided to pursue that full time
and started preparing to transfer to a film school in the coming year. Originally, I applied to a bunch
of film schools and wanted to get into one of them. My deal with myself was that, 
even if I did not get into a film school, I would still try to make it in the film industry
in some capacity in the following year. Perhaps unsurprisingly, I did not initially 
make it into film school and needed to go into that Plan B approach. 

So I moved to LA. I had saved up some money from working at restaurants had a reasonable safety net, though not indefinite. 
I applied to a bunch of unpaid Craigslist film roles. 
At the time, that was pretty much how one got started in film, if you didn't go to film school
and probably even if you did. 

Luckily (?), I landed a role on a feature film as a production assistant. Unpaid. Well,
mostly unpaid. It paid 75 dollars a week, which didn't even really cover gas in metropolitan LA for
the week. My first week on the film, I chatted with the folks in the lighting department and
asked if I could work with them more closely and get trained there. They needed the help and so
the Best Boy Electric took me under his wing and I was in the lighting department from there on.
When production needed help, they initially asked me, but the electrical department said they needed 
me and that was that.

From that job, and other unpaid roles on Craigslist, I was able to cobble together enough of a living
to make it in Los Angeles for a time. Again, not indefinite. I worked on small movies, ad shoots, etc. 
At times I temped, but always wanted to stay in film. My favorite gig from this period was working 
on Hallmark movies, which had low pay for most metrics but were extremely reliable and basically
an assembly line. And, all during this time, I tried my best to stay in the film lighting / grip 
departments and build up comfort there. 

Halfway through this year, I decided I would apply to film school again for the coming year.
If things were going well, I would turn down the opportunity to go back to school if I got in.
This time I did manage to get in! 

When I started in film school, I had a huge advantage - I had worked professionally in the film industry
for a year prior to starting in film school. That's not to say I knew everything about lighting, camera, etc,
but that it gave me a slight edge on how film sets worked, how to get things done, and how to work with a crew.
More importantly, I knew *what I wanted*. I wanted to be a Cinematgrapher, and at this point I had 
experience in the lighting and grip department. In the beginning, I was able to establish a kind of 
niche for myself on these sets where folks knew that I wanted to be a Cinematographer and had this particular skill set.
They eventually started to call on me for that, which built up a bit of momentum and helped me extend
my advantage and get to know more folks in the film school.

So why do I introduce all of this? I think it's important to know what you want and where you're heading. 
My experience in film school is that the folks who came in wanting to be a director or writer had a bit of an uphill climb,
as there can only be so many of those folks on a movie (one director, one writer). And the expectation
was that we were regularly working on set, so folks without a clear or perhaps more achievable goal of 
what they wanted to do wound up getting typecast into whatever other people observed them doing. For example,
if someone was a pretty good script supervisor, other people would start to call on them to do that again for their movies.
But if that's not what that person wanted, it can be hard to escape it and transition into something else. If you want to be 
a writer and you're always getting called to be on set as a boom operator, how much experience are you getting writing?

So I suggest: know what you want to do.

This applies professionally as well. I'm in software now (happily!) and have
been a software engineer for 12+ years. In one on ones, sometimes I like to ask
folks what they want to do, where they want to grow, what 
they're interested in doing more of. It's a hard question to answer! It can
require some real soul searching.  Do you want to go more into infrastructure? AI? Front-end? 
Let's say you want to specialize in backend - do you care more about learning about a particular language? Domain? What are you looking for? Do you want to become a manager at some point? These are hard questions!

But if you don't pick what you want, someone else will choose for you. And you
might not like what they choose. 


OK, I actually have a coda to this. It may not surprise you that "what I want" has changed dramatically over time. I'm obviously not a cinematographer now, and I'm not a colorist either. So what happened? 

I have a post with more background in [My Path to Software Engineering](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2019/12/09/my-path-to-engineering/), but I want to zoom in one on example:
>In my senior year, I had the opportunity to intern at Light Iron, which was, at the time, a small start-up post-production facility that specialized in color correction. It had 9 employees when I joined (including me) and most of them were founders. . . .

> After graduation, I asked the Chief Technology Officer if I could transition into a more technical role and he agreed. 

There's some backstory I initially didn't share here! I had started learning how to be a colorist.,
So I had been very clear that I wanted to be a colorist when I joined, and indeed that is what I wanted at the time. So they started to train me to be a colorist to achieve that goal. 

 And the process to do that is to learn to be a Conform Artist. Basically, if a colorist is like the person who applies Photoshop to a film, the Conform Artist is kind of like their assistant or editor. They work with editorial to take the finished cut of a movie, take the original source material, and marry them together. If Visual Effects delivers some more shots or changes to existing shots, the conform artist cuts those in too.

 As Is tarte dtraining to be a conform artist, I had a big challenge. I found it... boring? It's a challegning job, and it is pleasing - like putting together a puzzle. But for me personally, it wasn't what I wound up wanting. So I spoke to the CTO about a budding interest I had in technical areas, I had been working with him to set up the network racks, fix small computer issues for the staff, asist with flashing custom firmware on things, and basically I said to him "I want to work with you and do more of what you do", which I'm still eternally grateful that he said yes. At the time, (late 2012, early 2013) I had been reading hacker news and enjoyed learning about tech, so I was grateful that he was willing to put me under his wing.

 So the coda is to illustrate: it's ok to change your mind about what you want too! Sometimes the sense that leads us in a direction can shift and lead us in a different one.
