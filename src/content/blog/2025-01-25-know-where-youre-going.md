I have had a bit of a strange career history. 

In community college, I studied computer science and photography before shifting
into film production because I was drawn to visual storytelling. I wanted to
become a cinematographer.  I made a deal with myself: if applying to film school
didn’t work out, I’d still find a way into the industry. I wasn't accepted, so
I embraced Plan B.

I moved to LA with just enough savings from restaurant work to have a temporary
safety net. Like other hopeful filmmakers at the time, I started with unpaid Craigslist
gigs. My first break came as a production assistant on a feature film that paid
$75 a week -— barely enough for gas in LA. In my first week on that set, I gravitated to the
lighting department and asked if I could work more closely with them. The Best
Boy Electric took me under his wing, and I learned a great deal from working
alongside him.

Those early gigs—small movies, ad shoots, and a few Hallmark films—didn’t pay much, but they taught me the basics of working on set.

Halfway through this year, I decided I would apply to film school again for the coming year.
If things were going well, I would turn down the opportunity to go back to school if I got in.
This time I did manage to get in! 

When I started in film school, I had a huge advantage - I had worked professionally in the film industry
for a year prior to starting in film school. That's not to say I knew everything about lighting, camera, etc,
but that it gave me a slight edge on how film sets worked, how to get things done, and how to work with a crew.
More importantly, I knew *what I wanted*. I wanted to be a Cinematgrapher, and at this point I had 
experience in the lighting and grip department. In the beginning, I was able to establish a kind of 
niche for myself on these sets where folks knew that I wanted to be a Cinematographer and had this particular skill set.
They eventually started to call on me for that, which built up a bit of momentum and helped me extend
my advantage and get to know more folks in the film school.

So why share this story? It's important to know what you want and where you're heading. 
In film school, those without clear goals often got typecast into whatever others saw them doing well.
If you're always the script supervisor but want to write, how much writing experience are you getting?
If you don't pick what you want, someone else will choose for you.

Basically everyone wanted ot be a director or writer. Not many people set out to be a sound person, a cinematographer, or any of the other myriad roles on set. Establishing that niche help sets you apart, and more importantly gives you an opportunity to work towards what you actually want to do rather than what people think you may be good at, or how they see you.

This applies professionally as well. I'm in software now (happily!) and have
been a software engineer for 12+ years. In one-on-ones, I ask folks
what they want to do, where they want to grow, what they're interested in doing more of.
It's a hard question! Do you want to focus on infrastructure? AI? Front-end? 
If you're interested in backend, do you care more about a particular language? Domain?
Do you want to become a manager? These require real soul-searching.



OK, I actually have a coda to this. It may not surprise you that "what I want" has changed dramatically over time. I'm obviously not a cinematographer now, and I'm not a colorist either. So what happened? 

I have a post with more background in [My Path to Software Engineering](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2019/12/09/my-path-to-engineering/), but I want to zoom in one on example:
>In my senior year, I had the opportunity to intern at Light Iron, which was, at the time, a small start-up post-production facility that specialized in color correction. It had 9 employees when I joined (including me) and most of them were founders. . . .

> After graduation, I asked the Chief Technology Officer if I could transition into a more technical role and he agreed. 

There's some backstory I initially didn't share here! I had started learning how to be a colorist.,
So I had been very clear that I wanted to be a colorist when I joined, and indeed that is what I wanted at the time. So they started to train me to be a colorist to achieve that goal. 

 And the process to do that is to learn to be a Conform Artist. Basically, if a colorist is like the person who applies Photoshop to a film, the Conform Artist is kind of like their assistant or editor. They work with editorial to take the finished cut of a movie, take the original source material, and marry them together. If Visual Effects delivers some more shots or changes to existing shots, the conform artist cuts those in too.

 As Is tarte dtraining to be a conform artist, I had a big challenge. I found it... boring? It's a challegning job, and it is pleasing - like putting together a puzzle. But for me personally, it wasn't what I wound up wanting. So I spoke to the CTO about a budding interest I had in technical areas, I had been working with him to set up the network racks, fix small computer issues for the staff, asist with flashing custom firmware on things, and basically I said to him "I want to work with you and do more of what you do", which I'm still eternally grateful that he said yes. At the time, (late 2012, early 2013) I had been reading hacker news and enjoyed learning about tech, so I was grateful that he was willing to put me under his wing.

The lesson here? It's vital to know what you want - but it's also okay to change your mind
as you grow and learn. Sometimes the path that leads us in one direction can shift and
guide us somewhere even better.
