A friend recently asked me what I've used to improve as a software engineer.
I mentioned a bunch of resources. When he later asked me for a list, I
realized I didn't have one yet. In this post, I'll share resources that have
helped me grow.

A quick word of advice before I go into the list. I think the key
to improvement boils down to two things:

1. Regular, purposeful practice
2. Research

For the first point, make practice a habit and a regular part of your schedule.
I usually schedule about 30 minutes to an hour each weeknight for
programming-related activities. I've done that for a few years and I've noticed
improvement.

For the second point, even a small amount of research can
help you improve. As obvious as it sounds to Google how to do something, we
often don't think to do it. As an example, I didn't think to look for [how to
ask good questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/).

Okay! Let's talk resources.

## Blogs

I usually read stories and
articles when they appear on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). A few
authors show up with consistently good posts:

* **[Dan Luu](http://danluu.com/)**: His
    writing on [his experience at big
    companies](http://danluu.com/startup-tradeoffs/) led me to consider
    joining [Amazon](http://amazon.com/) over another startup.
    I often reference his post on [normalization of
    deviance](http://danluu.com/wat/) as a model of how we get accustomed to
    weird processes. Finally, he has a list of [great programming
    blogs](http://danluu.com/programming-blogs/) and
    [books](http://danluu.com/programming-books/). That's just a subset.

* **[High Scalability](http://highscalability.com/)**: This is a good and
    well-known blog on building complex
    systems at scale. I like the [post on Netflix's
    architecture](http://highscalability.com/blog/2017/12/11/netflix-what-happens-when-you-press-play.html)
    as an introduction.

* **[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/)**: Julia writes infectiously exciting blog posts.
    Want to learn about [what happens when you start a process on
    Linux](https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/10/04/exec-will-eat-your-brain/)? What
    about [how to decide what to work
    on](https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/08/16/how-do-you-work-on-something-important/)?
    Maybe you didn't before but I'm guessing you're curious now.


## Books

I have a hard time sitting down and powering through a programming book, unless
I'm on an airplane where I have nothing more interesting to do. If a book feels
immediately practical and / or uses exercises, I have an easier time with it. Of
the software books I've read, I recommend:

* **[Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)**: This book
    basically started my career in software. It's more basic than the other
    books on this list but it's _fun_ in a way that most programming books are not.

* **[Test-Driven Development with Python](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/)**:
    A great introduction to test-driven development, and practical if you're
    working in Python or Django. I like hands-on style books and this one is
    essentially a long tutorial.

* **[Effective
    Java](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-3rd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997)**:
    I'm new to Java and it's wonderful to have an expert like Joshua Bloch
    explaining best practices in his native programming language. Well-reasoned and
    thoughtful.

* **[Continuous
    Delivery](https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321601912)**:
    Filled with good advice for automating and improving your DevOps processes.
    It's good for poking the introspective part and encouraging you to examine
    what can be improved.

* **[Cracking the Coding
    Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)**:
    I recommend this book in the [job hunt
    guide](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2016/01/21/job-hunt-guide.html) and think
    it's good even as a general purpose algorithms book. I encourage you to do
    the exercises.

## Talks

Listening to software-related talks is one of my favorite tricks to improve as
an engineer. I [wrote
a post](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/09/10/10-software-talks-to-listen-to.html)
a few years ago about a few of my favorite talks.

I have a few sources that I check for programming-related videos:

* **[Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts)**: [Gary
    Bernhardt](https://twitter.com/garybernhardt)'s screencast series for
    working professionals. When I watched through the first season,
    it changed how I use the command line. Although not representative of
    the rest of the screencasts, I love Gary's
    [wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) talk.

* **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)**: It's easy to overlook.
    Many conferences post their recorded talks on YouTube, such as [PyCon
    2017](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrJhliKNQ8g0qoE_zvL8eVg) and [Strange
    Loop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_QIfHvN9auy2CoOdSfMWDw/playlists).
    Sorting by views is the killer feature for finding good material within
    a particular conference. [youtube-dl](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl) can
    save bandwidth if you listen while travelling.

* **[Deconstruct
    Conf](https://www.deconstructconf.com/)**: A software conference organized
    by Gary Bernhardt. Maybe it's cheating to include this, since I already
    mentioned Gary. Oh well! I enjoyed
    "[Patterns failed. Why? Should we
    care?](https://www.deconstructconf.com/2017/brian-marick-patterns-failed-why-should-we-care)"
    and look forward to the 2018 videos.

## Courses

Massively Online Open Courses (MOOCs) offer an amazing way to for growing as an
engineer. I've used MOOCs since 2011, when Stanford offered three courses online
for free and completed something like 15 MOOCs so far. This is what I'd recommend:

* **[Georgia Tech's Online Master of Science in Computer
    Science](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/)**: I started this program while
    already working as an engineer and completed it this past summer.
    I think it's the most practical way
    to pursue a master's degree in computer science while working.

* **[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)**: Great online courses and a huge
    variety.  I enjoyed the [algorithms
    courses](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms).

* **[Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/report/top-moocs/)**: Class
    Central has reviews and rankings for courses, which is useful for navigating
    the recent explosion in the variety and number of courses.


That's all I have for now! I'm still learning too so I'll update this post as
I encounter new resources to recommend.
