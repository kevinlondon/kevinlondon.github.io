Certain Python functions should not be used or should be used only with
caution. Python's documentation typically includes a note about the dangers but
does not always fully illustrate why the function is risky. We will discuss
a few dangerous categories of Python functions and some alternatives.  If you
see these used in the wild, it may not be bad but we should pay close attention
to their usage.

The Command Injection Series
----------------------------

The first group of dangerous Python functions revolve around trusting
user-provided input and piping it into a shell. 


Why they're useful
==================

Sometimes you need to send a command-line application and it's convenient to do
that using Python's subprocess module using
[`subprocess.call()`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/subprocess.html) and
setting `shell=True`. 

[`os.system()`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.system) and
[`os.popen*()`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html#os.popen) have been
deprecated since Python 2.6 in favor of the subprocess module. They have
a simple API and they've been around for a while so you may run into them in
older applications.


Why they're dangerous
======================

Using `shell=True` (or any of the similar command-line oriented tools in `os`),
can expose you to security risks if someone crafts input to
issue different commands than the ones you intended. 


A dangerous example
===================

Let's say we want to write a function to transcode a user-specified video file
into a different format. We ask the user where to find the file on disk and
then run it through [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) to transcode it. What
could go wrong?

```python
import subprocess

def transcode_file():
    filename = raw_input('Please provide the path for the file to transcode: ')
    command = 'ffmpeg -i "{source}" output_file.mpg'.format(source=filename)
    subprocess.call(command, shell=True)  # a bad idea!
```

What if someone provides a file with a name like `"; rm -rf /`?  If the host
machine runs the Python process as a privileged user, that could delete all
of the files on the machine. That's bad.


What to use instead
===================

`subprocess` with `shell=False`. It protects you against most of the risk
associated with piping commands to the shell. If you go this route,
[`shlex.split()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shlex.html#shlex.split)
makes it easier to prepare the command (and is what the Python docs recommend).

[`sh`](https://amoffat.github.io/sh/) - Useful for issuing commands to other
applications. I had some trouble issuing complex commands through `sh` before
because of the way it quotes variables. That said, if it works for your use
case, then go for it!


If you must use them...
=======================

Escape your variables! You can use
[`pipes.quote()`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pipes.html#pipes.quote) for
that if you're using Python 2.x or
[`shlex.quote()`](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/shlex.html#shlex.quote)
if you're using Python 3.3 or newer.

Code Injection - exec, eval
---------------------------

The second group of dangerous functions relate to taking input and 
interpreting it as Python code.


Why they're useful
==================

[`exec()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#exec) and
[`eval()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#eval) take strings
and turn them into executable code. They can be useful, especially if you are
the one who controls the input. As one example, I've used `eval` before 
to evaluate a large dict-like string into a dictionary.


Why they're dangerous
=====================

Again, we do not know what the user will provide in all cases. `eval()` and
`exec()` will execute we feed them. A user could build a string so that it runs
other Python functions to potentially erase all your data, expose your secret
keys, dump your database, or perform other malicious actions.

A dangerous example
===================

Related to the previous example, suppose you're `eval`ing a string that looks
like this: `"os.system('rm -rf /')  # dangerous!"`. It, too, could erase all
your files.

What to use instead
===================

It depends. If you're trying to use `eval` or `exec`, 
there may be a better way to accomplish what you're trying to do. 
The functions can be used in many different ways so it is challenging to provide
an alternative that covers all use cases.

If you're using them to perform serialization / deserialization, it would
probably be better to use another format, such as JSON, which can be loaded
with the [`json`](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/json.html) module.


If you must use them...
=======================

Again, escape your input. You can also disable the built-ins to make it harder
to craft malicious input, which Ned Batchelder covers in 
[Eval really is dangerous](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201206/eval_really_is_dangerous.html).

Next time...
------------

We've covered ways in which user input can pose serious risks to Python
applications. In the 
[next part of this series](http://kevinlondon.com/2015/08/15/dangerous-python-functions-pt2.html), 
we'll discuss issues related to deserializing data, loading yaml configurations,
information leakage, and more.
