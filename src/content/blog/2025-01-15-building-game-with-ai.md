I don't think of myself as a game developer - because I've never really made a
game. As a kid, I made some games in the Starcraft and Warcraft III map engines.
I'd often provide feedback to friends making their own games. I took a game dev
class in community college and built an insane 3D Breakout where you play as the
paddle and have the POV as the paddle.

So yeah, not a game developer.

I have enjoyed games for a while though. And in particular, I love game demos. Small proofs of concept, little commitment. Just a fun way to go through some example. I'd love those game demo disks of the late 90s where you'd have 40-50 demos, and most of them were insanely bad. So yeah, novelty is a good thing.

This weekend, I decided to start trying to make my own game.

In the past, how I'd approach this was:
1. Choose some game engine based on what people seem to like at the time
2. Read through tutorials, and make a game over the course of a week or so, mostly working at night
3. Completely lose interest in the original thing I wanted to make by the time I had sufficient preparation to make it.

With that loop in mind, I decided to try this a different way, this time instead starting with the idea that I could leverage some of the advanced in AI dev, particularly Cursor and Claude 4.

Claude 4 has gotten much better than Claude 3. Like - much better. It has its own tool usage, it runs its own tests. So with its new-found autonomy, it makes a good partner for building the game. 

I started out with the hypothesis  that investing $20 in Cursor for Claude was kind of like what I might spend on some random game. And, interestingly, that is how it felt!

Granted, the feedback loop is longer. 


Fill in the middle section with feedback about what I iterated on, how I started with the game dev itself, including ideation, the feedback loop, and ultimately building and shipping a thing.

I don't know exactly how I feel about this now that I've done it. It is fun, and it takes real artistry to make a game, most of which I've sidestepped. I think as AI takes a larger role in what we do, it also means that we have to be better collaborators and wear a more critical hat when providing feedback. Tastemaking becomes significantly more important if we're doing less of the active contribtuion. Telling it what we want or don't want for example.
