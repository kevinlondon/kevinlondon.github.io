Last weekend I spent $20 on Cursor credits and built a game about software development. The weird part? Building the game felt more like playing a game than most games I've actually played recently.

I kept thinking about this while working on "Velocity," which is a sprint-based game where you manage tasks and make tech tree investments. The irony wasn't lost on me—I was building a game about building software while using AI tools that made the building process feel like a game. The meta-layers kept stacking.

## The feedback loop

When I ask Cursor to "create a task card component with click handlers" and watch it generate exactly what I need, there's a satisfying hit. When the component works on the first try, it feels like landing a combo in a fighting game.

Traditional games give you: action → result → progress → action. AI-assisted development creates a similar loop: prompt → code → iterate → prompt. Each working feature unlocks new possibilities. Getting the basic game loop running opens up balancing decisions. Implementing the tech tree leads to questions about player agency.

The progression system is there too. The complexity scales naturally, just like a well-designed game.

## Different value proposition

Twenty dollars used to buy you a finished product—maybe 10-20 hours of gameplay. That same $20 for Cursor got me:

- 20+ hours of development experience
- A working prototype at the end
- Skills that transfer to future projects
- The satisfaction of creating something from nothing

It's like buying a game that comes with mod tools, except the mod tools are the game. The line between playing and making has blurred.

## Collaborative AI

Tools like godot-mcp take this further. The AI can manage its own launch sequences, update dependencies, and orchestrate workflows. I've had moments where I'll ask Cursor to implement a feature, and it suggests architectural improvements I hadn't considered.

At some point, you're not really "using" the AI anymore—you're collaborating with it. It becomes less like a tool and more like a co-player who happens to be really good at the technical execution while you focus on the design decisions.

## Removing friction

Building Velocity with AI assistance has been genuinely fun in a way that coding projects usually aren't for me. The rapid iteration creates an addictive flow state. I'll think "what if tasks had different risk/reward profiles?" and twenty minutes later I'm playtesting that exact mechanic.

The traditional friction points—setting up boilerplate, debugging syntax errors, reading documentation—mostly disappear. What remains is the pure creative problem-solving that drew me to programming in the first place, but with the gratification timeline compressed from hours to minutes.

This changes the barrier to entry for game development. The traditional path required years of learning engines, programming languages, art pipelines, and sound design. Now you can start with an idea and have something playable in hours.

More than that, the process of building becomes accessible as entertainment. You don't need to be a "game developer" to enjoy game development. The AI handles enough of the technical complexity that the creative and design challenges become the primary loop.

## Looking ahead

I suspect we're in the early stages of this shift. The AI tools will get better, the feedback loops will get tighter, and the line between consumption and creation will continue to blur.

Maybe in a year, the idea of passively consuming entertainment will feel as outdated as going to a video rental store. If you're curious about trying it yourself, the barrier to entry has never been lower. Grab $20 worth of AI credits and see what you can build in a weekend.

For now, I'm enjoying the game of making games. And who knows? By the time you finish reading this, the tools might be even better than when I started writing it.
