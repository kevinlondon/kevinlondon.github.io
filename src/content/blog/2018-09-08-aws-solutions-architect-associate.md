I recently passed the [Solutions Architect - Associate
certification](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
for AWS and thought I'd share notes on preparing for the
certification. In
a previous post, I covered the [overall certification process]({{ site.baseurl
}}{% post_url 2018-09-04-aws-certifications %}) and general tips. Let's get
to it!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why should I study for this cert in particular?

The AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate exam provides the best overview
of the certifications. It covers how to use most commonly used AWS services to
build highly available and reliable services. It's ideal if you
have some experience working with AWS and designing distributed applications,
but you don't need to be an expert in it.

### What does it cover?

We'll cover this in more detail below. In short, it covers the core AWS services
that you're like to encounter. It primarily covers:

* [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)
* [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/)
* [Simple Storage Service (S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
* [Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
* [Relational Database Service (RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)
* [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
* [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/)
* [Simple Queue Service (SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)
* [Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/)
* [Cloudwatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)

### Which version should I take?

At the time of writing, there's two versions of the certification:

* Pre-2018
* [The 2018 version, released in
    February](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/02/updated-aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-exam-now-available/)

If you're starting now, I'd recommend taking the 2018 version as it will cover
newer services and includes segments from the [Well-Architected
Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/) material.
I took the pre-2018 version because the material I found online only covered
that version at the time. Because I studied for the older exam, some of the tips
in this guide may not be applicable to the newer exam.

### How did you prepare?

I covered my general study recommendations in the [Intro to AWS
Certifications]({{ site.baseurl
}}{% post_url 2018-09-04-aws-certifications %})
post, so please check that out. In addition, I consulted posts about other
people's experience taking the exams. In particular, I read through:

* [My Path to Solutions Architect
    Associate](https://acloud.guru/forums/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/discussion/-KKr5HCv2bzH3EOBSUAt/my_path_to_solutions_architect)
* [A Cloud Guru
    FAQs](https://acloud.guru/forums/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/discussion/-KSS5nf3pekHgwDEuNnF/new_here__read_this_through!)
* [Exam
    Feedback](https://acloud.guru/forums/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/discussion/-KSDNs4nfg5ikp6yBN9l/exam_feedback)

One final note is that you should build things in AWS.
Reviewing the lectures and reading through docs is helpful, but actually working
with the services will help it stick.

### How long did it take you?

The test took me longer than the Developer - Associate exam because it was my
first AWS cert. I may have overprepared because I wanted to pass on the first attempt.
Some numbers:

* [LinuxAcademy course](https://linuxacademy.com/cp/modules/view/id/228):
    * ~12 hours: 20 hours of lectures at 1.5 or 2x speed
    * ~10 hours: Labs
    * 5 hours: 4x final practice exams
* 4 hours: 3x final practice exams from [ACloudGuru
    course](https://acloud.guru/course/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/)
* 5 hours: Reading online resources and other posts
* ~10 hours: Reading the AWS Whitepapers and FAQs

That's about 46 hours total. It sounds like a long time when
I look at the numbers. In practice, I'd often spend an hour or so a night and
sometimes a few hours on the weekend. I studied over 2 or 3 months before I took
the exam.

### What should I know about the test?

* It's multiple choice or multiple answer.
* For the newer exam (2018), you have 130 minutes to answer 50 to 70 questions.
* It costs $150 to take the exam.
