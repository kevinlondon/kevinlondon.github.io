## The Mystery of Amazon Promotions

When I started at Amazon, the promotion process felt like a mystery. How
does the company choose who to promote? What criteria do they use? And why
would they ever want to promote me, especially when I grappled with [impostor
syndrome](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/05/27/impostor-syndrome-and-me)?

## Understanding Amazon's Promotion Philosophy

My promotion journey took about 2 years from the moment I first felt ready.
While it was often frustrating, I learned that Amazon's cautious approach to
promotions serves a few key purposes:

1. **Consistency at the Next Level**: Amazon promotes engineers who consistently demonstrate
   they are performing at the next job level, reducing the risk of premature promotions.

2. **Minimizing Job Level Shock**: Amazon employees can see each other's job level. As soon as
   someone sees your job level, they set expectations of what individuals at that job level can do,
   so delaying this can protect the individual from being judged too early. This can particularly
   matter for performance evaluations where everyone is measured against their peers.

## The Preparation Phase

During this period, I spent about a year preparing for my promotion. Here's what worked for me:

- Created detailed work summaries documenting my contributions
- Sought feedback from senior engineers about gaps in my experience
- Focused on demonstrating next-level behaviors before the promotion
- Actively looked for opportunities to increase my impact

## Taking on Bigger Challenges

Based on feedback, I identified that I needed to broaden my impact. I took on a large project that involved:
- Coordinating with approximately ten engineers across multiple teams
- Leading technical design discussions
- Mentoring junior engineers through complex problems
- Documenting learnings and best practices for future teams

## The Promotion Process

The path wasn't straightforward:

1. **First Attempt**: Despite warnings that I might not be ready, I submitted my promotion document to gain experience with the process. It was rejected, but provided valuable feedback.

2. **Learning and Adaptation**: I carefully analyzed the reviewers' feedback and identified specific gaps to address.

3. **Second Attempt**: After addressing the feedback and demonstrating consistent next-level performance, my promotion was approved.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Patience is crucial**: The process takes time for a reason – use it to truly grow into the next level.
2. **Seek honest feedback**: Find mentors who will tell you the truth about your readiness.
3. **Document everything**: Keep detailed records of your contributions and impact.
4. **Think beyond your team**: Look for opportunities to influence across organizational boundaries.

## What's Next?

If you're pursuing a promotion at Amazon or a similar tech company:
- Start preparing early
- Find a mentor who has successfully navigated the process
- Focus on demonstrating next-level impact before seeking the promotion
- Don't be discouraged by initial setbacks – use them as learning opportunities

Remember: the promotion process isn't just about recognition – it's about ensuring you're ready to succeed at the next level. I wish you luck!
