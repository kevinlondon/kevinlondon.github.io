Are you thinking about giving a talk but unsure where to start? That's usually
how I feel at the beginning of my preparation. I've given a few talks and
I feel like I learn something new every time. It can be intimidating to go
from idea to presentation, so I'd like to share my current process. I 
typically follow these steps:

1. Pick a topic.
2. Write about it.
3. Pick the points you want the audience to come away with.
4. Write the outline on paper
5. Prepare a first draft of slides.
6. Try to give the talk aloud, warts and all.
7. Research areas where the talk needs work.
8. Practice more.
9. Finalize slides.
10. Practice as much as possible.
11. Give the talk!

No one has ever said "It's a simple 11 point plan!" and meant it. 
That said, most of these go by quickly. Let's go into each item in detail.


Pick a Topic
---------------

I sometimes get stuck when I try to come up with a topic. 
Good news: You do not have to be an expert to give a talk!

I pick topics I feel like I know but want to learn more about. 
The topics I've chosen tend to come from one of the following:

1. A question someone has asked me (e.g. How do we write good tests for code?)
2. Something I had to figure out (e.g. How do I do code reviews?)
3. Something I'd like to learn more about (e.g. What should I know about application security?)

I find that presenting a topic [cements
learning](http://ideas.time.com/2011/11/30/the-protege-effect/) and helps me
feel more like an expert in that area once I'm done.


Write About It
-----------------

I like to write a long-form blog post on the topic before I continue.
This offers some benefits that make the rest of the process easier:

1. You're get to consider what you think is important about the topic.
2. You get early feedback.
3. You can later point talk attendees to additional material
if they'd like to learn more.
4. You gain confidence on the subject.
5. You find out if other people have interest in your topic.

When giving a talk, my goal is to cover a broad idea in a way that sticks 
with the audience. Blog posts, however, can go into more detail and serve
as a reference.

For example, I wrote about [code
reviews](http://kevinlondon.com/2015/05/05/code-review-best-practices.html)
before I gave a talk on them. My talk covered many of the same points but it
also provided more context and personal examples.

If you can, seek out feedback on your blog post.
I find it's gentler to correct mistakes at this stage than in later ones.


Pick the Primary Points
--------------------------

Great talks contain a few simple points.  A common recommendation I've read is
that you should pick the central idea that you'd like people to leave with and
perhaps 2-3 points that support it. Anything else and it can be hard to
remember.

Picking the primary focus of your talk allows you to streamline. 
The typical 30 minute slot will not be long enough to go
into depth on a topic. That's okay.

Writing out your ideas on paper allows you to see which ones you feel strongly
about and something about writing on paper helps me condense ideas more
effectively. I'll usually write too much and then edit it down later.


Write the Rough Outline
--------------------------

The outline is a simpler version of the blog post that we completed earlier.
I include as many anecdotes and personal stories as possible in the outline so
I remember to include them in the talk. This is not something I release so
I don't bother to editing or filling it in completely.


Prepare a First Draft of the Slides
--------------------------------------

At this point, I like to create the first pass on the slides. I use 
big text and no more than a few words per slide. The less text that you can
put on the slides, the better. It becomes too tempting to read slides and
that can prevent you from connecting with the audience.

If I'm giving a 30 minute talk, I aim for something like 30-60 slides. 
The style doesn't matter because the slides will probably change.

Practice the Talk Out Loud
-----------------------------

I find the first read of a talk intimidating because it tells me
how well prepared I feel and what areas need improvement.  I time myself
and advance through my slides as I talk. Sometimes I'll make notes as I go if
I feel particularly stuck. After I do a runthrough, I make notes
about what felt weak and what felt good. 


Research Weak Spots
------------------------------------------------

What academic articles are available on my topic? Are there other blog posts?
Have others given recorded talks that I can watch?
After I finish the research, I continue adding slides where I need help 
and removing ones that feel extraneous.


Practice More
----------------

I like to time the talk and give it aloud as though I were presenting it,
usually 2-3 more times. Sometimes I'll pick a friend to present to them in order
to get some feedback on the content of the presentation. The slides can still be
temporary.

Finalize the Slides
-------------------

Once I feel good about the presentation's content, I like to go back through and
finalize both the text and the style of the slides. I follow the [Zach Holman
philosophy](http://zachholman.com/posts/slide-design-for-developers/) of
choosing the biggest font you can get away with.

Here's a couple examples from my previous talks:

* [Intro to Code Reviews](http://kevinlondon.com/2015/06/25/intro-to-code-reviews-talk.html)
* [Finding Vulnerabilities with Bandit](http://kevinlondon.com/2015/09/24/finding-vulnerabilities-with-bandit.html)

One Final Practice
----------------------

I do one practice with the final slides. Presenting it to a small group can be
a great confidence builder. If that's not possible, I practice and time it without
stopping for any reason. I think recovering from problems can be as important
as how delivering the content, particularly in front of others.


Give the Talk!
------------------

The easy part. 

If you've practiced the talk 4-5 times, you should have it down
by this point. It's nerve-wracking to wait before getting up to give a talk
but I find that once I start, it feels natural. Some important points 
to remember during the talk itself: 

* Slow down. 
* Speak clearly.
* Make eye contact.

Questions usually follow the talk but they're not as scary as you might imagine.
I like questions. It shows where I could improve or clarify the
presentation in the future. Leave a few minutes for discussion and be 
sure to repeat the questions that are asked.


Bonus: Post the Slides Online
-----------------------------

Attendees may want to refer to them or you may find yourself referencing
the slides for a post like this one!


Thanks for reading, I hope that's helpful if you're planning to prepare a talk.
If you have questions about what would make a good topic or you get stuck,
please feel free to contact me! I'd love to help.
