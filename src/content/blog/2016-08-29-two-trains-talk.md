Have you ever heard someone say, 'This code sucks. We need to rewrite it.'?

I've been there and it usually doesn't end well. We'll discuss analogies around

I originally gave this talk for a [SoCal Python
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/socalpython/events/233187442/) at
[ChowNow's](https://www.chownow.com) HQ.
