A brief update to the
[earlier](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/07/26/dangerous-python-functions.html) [posts](https://www.kevinlondon.com/2015/08/15/dangerous-python-functions-pt2.html) about insecure Python functions. I came
across one more that's similar to the Pickle section from Part 2. This
one uses [`jsonpickle`](https://github.com/jsonpickle/jsonpickle).

Here's a working exploit for that one:

Their docs also mention the [security
implications](https://jsonpickle.github.io/#module-jsonpickle) but it can be easy to miss.
As a reminder, don't use anything that aspires to be Pickle.
