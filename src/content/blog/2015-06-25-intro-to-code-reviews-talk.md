If you've never participated in a code review before, it can be tough to know
where to start. This talk aims to give you the tools you'd need to start 
using code reviews as part of your team or even on your own. It covers
the benefits of code reviews, some items to check, and how to go about 
performing them.

I originally gave this talk at an [LA Django](http://www.meetup.com/ladjango/events/222881764/) meetup.
