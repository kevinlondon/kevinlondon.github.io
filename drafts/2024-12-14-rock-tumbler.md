title: Rock Tumbler Thinking
---

I'm not sure if cognition works this way for anyone else, but sometimes I have to offer folks a disclaimer on how my brain works. Namely, it can be the case that it takes me quite a while to process an idea. When I put it in my async processing queue, I think of it as putting something in the rock tumbler.

What I was a kid, I had the good fortune of getting a rock tumbler. I was extremely excited for this. At the time, I loved geodes and such, and would collect them when we went to stores. So having my own machine that could transform rocks into geodes, or at least expose them? Pretty cool.

What I didn't know or appreciate at the time was how insanely loud they were. So we put it into the basement before turning it on, and even in other parts of the house I could hear the chuck-chuck-chuck sound of rocks crashing against eachother from the basement.

After a while of this noise and cacophony, something beautiful would come out the other side.

So I think about the way these long-process thoughts take in a similar manner. Sometimes it can take quite a while for me to process something, and so it goes into the rock tumbler. After colliding with other thoughts, eventually I'll have processed it enough to have collected the (hopefully) shiny jewel within.
