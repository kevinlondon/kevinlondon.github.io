title: What should we do about AI?
isDraft: true

If we assume for a moment that the AI-pillers are true - that there really is impending AGI or "powerful AI" or whatever definition you have in mind - what should we be doing now? How should it inform current actions?

If we also assume that something like Situtational Awareness is true/ accurate for some definiton of that, again we have to think: What does this mean for me now?

I don't know. I've read about this and thought about it and have zero answers. If a machine can suddenly do nearly as good a job as I can at most things - writing, thinking, processing - what role do I have in that equation? Can we find historical reference for waht can be done in times of dramatic changes or shifts? And if not, what will it be like when there's the "final invention"?

This is an exploratory post - I don't have answers. If you're looking for them, this is just the best that I've figured out for myself. Take that as you will.
