Hans Christian Andersen wrote a short story called the [Princess and the
Pea](https://andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/hersholt/ThePrincessOnThePea_e.html). I'd
recommend reading it before we continue here because it's so short.

The TL;DR is that a Prince found his Princess because she was
sensitive to a single pea underneath many layers of bedding. The story hasn't
exactly aged well (Is this a criteria for a mate? What's going on with
the gender expectations?) but I think about it often, especially at work.

To me, this story demonstrates the importance of fighting against friction, even
if it's something small.
It's so easy to become accustomed to something working the way it does and not
noticing the pain. It's valuable to stay sensitive to annoying or
inconvenient things rather than becoming used to them.
I have watched people work around some crazy stuff to the point where they don't
even notice they're doing it.

### A Personal Experience

An aside. I worked in the film industry in post production.  We prepared movies
to go through color correction, which is like applying Adobe Photoshop to the
film. Part of that process required going back to the footage the camera
shot to ensure we had as high quality as possible.  Bringing the data
online involves searching a drive for the right clips selected by the editorial
staff and this took a looonnnnggg time. For example, it was common for the
process to take 2ish hours per 20 minutes of film to get the footage copied
over. This took place in a room that bills out for $500+ an hour and on
a purpose-built machine that cost $250K plus. We thought this was normal!

One day, I looked into the application logs to see why it took so long. What
I found is that the application spent 45 minutes looking through the drive
to find the right clips. The clips had a consistent layout in the clip and it
seemed crazy to me that it could take so long.

I made this a pet project. I brought it up to the company that created the
application with a recommended fix.
After some back and forth, we took the 45 minutes down to 2 minutes, a 22x
improvement. It took much less
time to prepare movies for color correction, which saved our customers and the
business money.

So what can we take away from this? It comes down to remaining sensitive
to pain. Instead of working around problems, stop and look at what you're doing.
If this is a repeated task, it's worth taking a step back and
examining if there's a better way to do it.


### Further Reading

If you're interested in this topic, I have two strong recommendations for you:

1. [The Design of Everyday
   Things](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654/ref=dp_ob_title_bk).
   Donald Norman hates friction in every day life. He hates doors that open the
   wrong way, items that are not designed with humans in mind, and anything
   confusing. One of my favorite ideas from his book is that there's no human
   error. Human error is machine error - it's in a system that someone designed
   shoddily enough to allow for humans to make a mistake. That's a great
   example of this concept.
1. [Dan Luu's Wat post](https://danluu.com/wat/) (aka Normalization of
   Deviance). This covers how we become numb to the bizarre workplace culture
   we put up with.

If you take anything away from this, I hope it's to be more sensitive to the
pain of little things. We don't have to accept it. We can change it. It's worth
being more like the Princess.
